  "justification": "Both the reference and generated MAL code snippets model the MITRE ATT&CK technique T0817, Drive-by Compromise, describing the scenario where a user is compromised through interaction with malicious web content via a browser. The core behavioral semantics are aligned: user visits site/clicks ad -> browser processes malicious content -> leads to system impact. However, the level of abstraction and structural semantics differ significantly. The reference provides a more abstract model with basic assets (Employee, Browser, OS, Computer) and general attack steps (pageVisited, maliciousWebsite, codeDelivered, runCode). The generated evidence presents a much more detailed and granular model, introducing specific web infrastructure assets (Website, AdProvider, CloudStorageBucket), more detailed attack steps (fetchAndRenderContent, processMaliciousScripts, exploitBrowserVulnerability, injectXSSPayload, distributeMaliciousAdToWebsites), specific defenses (sandboxing, script blocking, content vetting), named associations with explicit cardinalities, and probabilistic attack step outcomes. While both describe the same technique, the generated snippet expands significantly on the scope and detail, making the alignment Medium rather than High, as it introduces elements and granularity not present in the foundational reference model."
