Drive-by Compromise
Drive-by Compromise
Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist (i.e., Drive-by Target), including:

A legitimate website is compromised, allowing adversaries to inject malicious code
Script files served to a legitimate website from a publicly writeable cloud storage bucket are modified by an adversary
Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers (i.e., Malvertising)
Built-in web application interfaces that allow user-controllable content are leveraged for the insertion of malicious scripts or iFrames (e.g., cross-site scripting)
Browser push notifications may also be abused by adversaries and leveraged for malicious code injection via User Execution. By clicking "allow" on browser push notifications, users may be granting a website permission to run JavaScript code on their browser.[1][2][3]

Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or a particular region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known examples of this occurring.[4]

Typical drive-by compromise process:

A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting, notifications, or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.
If exploitation is successful, the adversary will gain code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place. In some cases, a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.
Unlike Exploit Public-Facing Application, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website. This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.

Mitigations
ID	Mitigation	Description
M1048	Application Isolation and Sandboxing	
Browser sandboxes can be used to mitigate some of the impact of exploitation, but sandbox escapes may still exist.[70][71]

Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of client-side exploitation. The risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in implementation may still exist for these types of systems.[71]

M1050	Exploit Protection	
Security applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior.[72] Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring.[73] Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility.

M1021	Restrict Web-Based Content	
Adblockers can help prevent malicious code served through ads from executing in the first place. Script blocking extensions can also help to prevent the execution of JavaScript.

Consider disabling browser push notifications from certain applications and browsers.[74][75][76]

M1051	Update Software	
Ensuring that all browsers and plugins are kept updated can help prevent the exploit phase of this technique. Use modern browsers with security features turned on.[77]

M1017	User Training	
Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction.

Detection
ID	Data Source	Data Component	Detects
DS0015	Application Log	Application Log Content	
Firewalls and proxies can inspect URLs for potentially known-bad domains or parameters. They can also do reputation-based analytics on websites and their requested resources such as how old a domain is, who it's registered to, if it's on a known bad list, or how many other users have connected to it before.

DS0022	File	File Creation	
Monitor for newly constructed files written to disk to gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. Detect browser process dropping files in suspicious locations (AppData, Temp, /tmp, /var/tmp). Identify exploit payloads (DLLs, JavaScript, shell scripts) written by the browser process.

(sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=11 Image="C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" OR Image="C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe")OR (sourcetype="/var/log/audit/audit.log" SYSCALL="open" path="/tmp/%" process="firefox" OR process="chrome")| eval risk_score = case( like(path, "%\Temp\%"), 5, like(path, "%AppData%"), 4, like(path, "%/var/tmp%"), 6)| where risk_score >= 5| table _time, host, process, path, risk_score

DS0029	Network Traffic	Network Connection Creation	
Monitor for newly constructed network connections to untrusted hosts that are used to send or receive data. Identify browser processes initiating connections to known malicious domains.Detect browser requests to suspicious IPs or domains classified under newly registered domains.Look for anomalous DNS queries and HTTP request patterns.

(sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=3 process="chrome.exe" OR process="firefox.exe")OR (source="cloud_dns_logs" category="newly_registered_domain")OR (source="/var/log/zeek/conn.log" dest_ip IN (malicious_ip_list))| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, domain, process| where count > 5

Network Traffic Content	
Detect suspicious script execution over HTTP/S. Identify JavaScript payloads with obfuscation or encoded execution. Look for exploit attempts in network payloads.

(EventCode=5156 dest_port=80 OR dest_port=443 process="chrome.exe" OR process="firefox.exe")OR (source="/var/log/zeek/http.log" method="GET" uri IN (suspicious_js_files))| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, uri, user_agent| where count > 3

DS0009	Process	Process Creation	
Look for behaviors on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behaviors of browser processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk, evidence of Process Injection for attempts to hide execution, or evidence of Discovery.
