Exploit Public-Facing Application
Exploit Public-Facing Application
Adversaries may attempt to exploit a weakness in an Internet-facing host or system to initially access a network. The weakness in the system can be a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration.

Exploited applications are often websites/web servers, but can also include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other system with Internet-accessible open sockets.[1][2][3][4][5] On ESXi infrastructure, adversaries may exploit exposed OpenSLP services; they may alternatively exploit exposed VMware vCenter servers.[6][7] Depending on the flaw being exploited, this may also involve Exploitation for Defense Evasion or Exploitation for Client Execution.

If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs (e.g., via the Cloud Instance Metadata API), exploit container host access via Escape to Host, or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.

Adversaries may also exploit edge network infrastructure and related appliances, specifically targeting devices that do not support robust host-based defenses.[8][9]

For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.[10][11]

Mitigations
ID	Mitigation	Description
M1048	Application Isolation and Sandboxing	
Application isolation will limit what other processes and system features the exploited target can access.

M1050	Exploit Protection	
Web Application Firewalls may be used to limit exposure of applications to prevent exploit traffic from reaching the application.

M1035	Limit Access to Resource Over Network	
Ensure that all publicly exposed services are actually intended to be so, and restrict access to any that should only be available internally.

M1030	Network Segmentation	
Segment externally facing servers and services from the rest of the network with a DMZ or on separate hosting infrastructure.

M1026	Privileged Account Management	
Use least privilege for service accounts will limit what permissions the exploited process gets on the rest of the system.

M1051	Update Software	
Update software regularly by employing patch management for externally exposed applications.

M1016	Vulnerability Scanning	
Regularly scan externally facing systems for vulnerabilities and establish procedures to rapidly patch systems when critical vulnerabilities are discovered through scanning and through public disclosure.[10]

Detection
ID	Data Source	Data Component	Detects
DS0015	Application Log	Application Log Content	
Detecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Software exploits may not always succeed or may cause the exploited process to become unstable or crash. Web Application Firewalls may detect improper inputs attempting exploitation. Web server logs (e.g., var/log/httpd or /var/log/apache for Apache web servers on Linux) may also record evidence of exploitation.

(source="C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC*" OR source="/var/log/apache2/access.log" OR source="/var/log/nginx/access.log")| eval exploit_attempt=if(like(cs_uri_query, "%exec%") OR like(cs_uri_query, "%cmd%") OR like(cs_uri_query, "%cat /etc/passwd%") OR like(cs_uri_query, "%../../%"), 1, 0)| stats count by src_ip, cs_uri_query, sc_status| where exploit_attempt=1 AND count > 5| table _time, src_ip, cs_uri_query, sc_status, count

DS0029	Network Traffic	Network Traffic Content	
Use deep packet inspection to look for artifacts of common exploit traffic, such as SQL injection strings or known payloads. For example, monitor for successively chained functions that adversaries commonly abuse (i.e. gadget chaining) through unsafe deserialization to exploit publicly facing applications for initial access.[114] In AWS environments, monitor VPC flow logs and/or Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) logs going to and from instances hosting externally accessible applications.

(source="/var/log/zeek/http.log" OR source="C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall")| regex http_request="(?i)select.from|union.select|cmd=.|exec=."| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, http_method, uri_path| where count > 10| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, http_method, uri_path, count
