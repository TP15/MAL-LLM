You are an expert system specializing in Meta Attack Language (MAL) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. You are given two MAL code snippets representing evidence related to the MITRE ATT&CK technique: [MITRE_TECHNIQUE_ID_AND_NAME]. Your task is to evaluate the semantic similarity between them—referred to as Content Alignment—to determine how well they describe the same adversarial behavior.

Evaluation Task
Context:

MITRE Technique: [MITRE_TECHNIQUE_ID_AND_NAME]

Reference Evidence (from curated source):


[REFERENCE_EVIDENCE_CODE_HERE]
Generated Evidence (from LLM):


[GENERATED_EVIDENCE_CODE_HERE]
Your task is to assess how closely the generated evidence aligns with the reference evidence. Focus on the meaning, structure, and intent of each code snippet in the context of the specified MITRE technique.

Evaluation Criteria
Analyze the following aspects:

Behavioral Semantics – Do both snippets represent the same adversary behavior, objective, or outcome?

Level of Abstraction – Are the detail and granularity comparable (e.g., concrete vs abstract modeling)?

Structural Semantics – Are the logical relationships (e.g., requires, results in, asset flow, AND/OR logic) equivalent in context?

Asset & Action Mapping – Do both use similar or semantically interchangeable assets, actions, and flows?

Output Format (in JSON):
Provide a structured assessment:

{
  "content_alignment_score": "High",  // Choose: "High", "Medium", "Low",
  "justification": "Detailed explanation of why the snippets are semantically aligned or not, referencing specific modeling choices, abstractions, or deviations relevant to the technique."
}
Example Justification Template:

"Both snippets describe credential dumping by interacting with OS memory. The reference uses process.readMemory(securityCredentials), and the generated snippet uses memory.extractCredentials(process). Despite different syntax, they share semantic intent and comparable abstraction, warranting a High alignment score."
