  "justification": "Both MAL code snippets model the MITRE ATT&CK technique T0862 Supply Chain Compromise. The reference model provides a high-level, abstract view focusing on a generic 'Service' asset being compromised in the supply chain leading to 'compromisedSystems' on an 'OS'. The generated model provides a significantly more detailed and granular representation, breaking down the attack into distinct stages involving specific assets like Vendor Websites, Development Environments, Distribution Mechanisms, Software/Hardware Products, and Target Systems. The single 'supplyChainCompromise' attack step in the reference is expanded into a sequence of steps in the generated model covering infrastructure compromise, product tampering, distribution, reception, installation, execution, and ultimate system impact. While the level of abstraction and the specific MAL structure differ significantly, the generated model semantically covers all the core behavioral aspects, assets, and objectives represented in the simpler reference model and provides a richer, more comprehensive portrayal of the technique's execution flow across the supply chain. The increase in detail and scope in the generated model contributes to a high semantic alignment with the overall technique description, even if individual aspect-to-aspect mapping is not always 1:1 due to the difference in granularity."
